# React App: Location Search and Directions

This React app provides two main features: location search and directions.

## Location Search

The app allows users to search for specific locations. It provides an input field where users can enter the name of a place, such as a city or an address. Upon submitting the search query, the app fetches data from a location database or an API and displays relevant results. Users can then view additional details about each location, such as its address, coordinates, or other relevant information.

## Navigation

In addition to location search, the app also offers a directions feature. Users can input their current location and the destination they want to reach. The app then calculates the best route between the two points, taking into account factors like traffic, distance, and estimated travel time.
